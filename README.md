# fun_with_mongoDB
A repo for projects that I've built using the MongoDB sample database

My goal is to practice basic CRUD functions, utilize an MVC approach, and experiment with MongoDB queries and aggregation pipelines.

Feel free to download and play with the code, but please note that this repo does not include an .env file with the database URI.  You'll need your own MongoDB setup and a copy of their sample data to make this work.

## NYC Eats ##

A simple website where users can search for NYC restaurants by cuisine type and borough.
